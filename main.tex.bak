% I have been preparing to work in the programming field for 5 years, and have found myself researching advanced fields and topics including type theory and compiler design. My adventrue has left me with more hands-on experience than I've seen from most udergraduates of computer science, and my aptitude is the product of self education. I've put myself through a practical bootcamp, where everything I learned was searched for. Although that also means that I haven't been formally trained by the standard cirriculum, I believe I am competent and skillful enough to perform above and beyond your expectations.\\
% Not only are my qualifications satisfactory for web development, but this job would be my first professional position, technically speaking. It would be an honour to work for. An office is farily alien to me, but the mentality isn't - this is a wonderful opportunity for me to finally start my professional career. If I were to be hired, I would dedicate myself to mastering every aspect of my position and improve the the company's potential with a unique addition.\\
% Excellence is what I strive for in life, and this position would give a kickstart to my personal and professional development. I am very cooperative and can adapt to any style of management. I am innovative, but also a team-player when necessary.\\
% I would be humbled if you considered my application for this position. I am confident that my performance would satisfy every need, and would be overjoyed to have an opportunity to work in this fast-paced and profitable field.
